# My first meme created

## Introduction
Hi guys I'm currently taking a very interesting course named **stats220** data technoology, If you are interested please come to our [course introduction page ](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1243) And also my [personal github page!](https://github.com/LIL-Jack/stats220.git)

### some idea about the meme
I love playing basketball, so i use three pictures of brain to be my meme, and three words which is NBA Player, MVP Player and NBA Champ. That means if i am a NBA player which i am really good at basketball, MVP player have to be so smart and really skilful at basketball, NBA Champ is for incredible Player. 


And this is my R code
```library(magick)
brain_1 <- image_read("brain_1.jpg") %>%  
  image_scale(450)

brain_2 <- image_read("brain_2.jpg") %>%
  image_scale(450)

brain_3 <- image_read("brain_3.webp") %>%
  image_scale(450)

# Creating text images
text_1 <- image_blank(width = 300, 
                          height = 300, 
                          color = "#000000") %>%
  image_annotate(text = "NBA Player",
                 color = "#FFFFFF",
                 size = 60,
                 font = "Impact",
                 gravity = "center")

text_2 <- image_blank(width = 300, 
                         height = 300, 
                         color = "#000000") %>%
  image_annotate(text = "MVP Player",
                 color = "#FFFFFF",
                 size = 60,
                 font = "Impact",
                 gravity = "center")

text_3 <- image_blank(width = 300, 
                       height = 300, 
                       color = "#000000") %>%
  image_annotate(text = "NBA Champ",
                 color = "#FFFFFF",
                 size = 60,
                 font = "Impact",
                 gravity = "center")

# Appending images horizontally
first_row <- c(brain_1, text_1) %>%
  image_append()

second_row <- c(brain_2, text_2) %>%
  image_append()

third_row <- c(brain_3, text_3) %>%
  image_append()

# Appending rows vertically to create a stacked image
brain123 <- c(first_row, second_row, third_row) %>%
  image_append(stack = TRUE)

# Displaying the output image
brain123


# Read the image files into R using the image_read function
brain_1 <- image_read("brain_1.jpg")
brain_2 <- image_read("brain_2.jpg")
brain_3 <- image_read("brain_3.webp")

# Combine the three images into a single list using the c() function
brain <- c(brain_1,brain_2, brain_3)

# Append the images vertically to create a single image
my_meme <- image_append(brain)

my_meme



image_write(meme, "my_meme.png")
```
